ALGs UDP

Certain NATs have implemented Application Level Gateways (ALGs) for
   various protocols, including protocols for negotiating peer-to-peer
   sessions, such as SIP.

   Certain NATs have these ALGs turned on permanently, others have them
   turned on by default but allow them to be turned off, and others have
   them turned off by default but allow them be turned on.

   NAT ALGs may interfere with UNSAF methods or protocols that try to be
   NAT-aware and therefore must be used with extreme caution.

   REQ-10:  To eliminate interference with UNSAF NAT traversal
      mechanisms and allow integrity protection of UDP communications,
      NAT ALGs for UDP-based protocols SHOULD be turned off.  Future
      standards track specifications that define ALGs can update this to
      recommend the defaults for the ALGs that they define.

      a) If a NAT includes ALGs, it is RECOMMENDED that the NAT allow
         the NAT administrator to enable or disable each ALG separately.

   Justification:  NAT ALGs may interfere with UNSAF methods.

      a) This requirement allows the user to enable those ALGs that are
         necessary to aid in the operation of some applications without
         enabling ALGs, which interfere with the operation of other
         applications.








Hairpinning Behavior UDP

If two hosts (called X1 and X2) are behind the same NAT and
   exchanging traffic, the NAT may allocate an address on the outside of
   the NAT for X2, called X2':x2'.  If X1 sends traffic to X2':x2', it
   goes to the NAT, which must relay the traffic from X1 to X2.  This is
   referred to as hairpinning and is illustrated below.

     NAT
   +----+ from X1:x1 to X2':x2'   +-----+ X1':x1'
   | X1 |>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>--+---
   +----+                         |  v  |
                                  |  v  |
                                  |  v  |
                                  |  v  |
   +----+ from X1':x1' to X2:x2   |  v  | X2':x2'
   | X2 |<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<--+---
   +----+                         +-----+

                           Hairpinning Behavior

   Hairpinning allows two endpoints on the internal side of the NAT to
   communicate even if they only use each other's external IP addresses
   and ports.

   More formally, a NAT that supports hairpinning forwards packets
   originating from an internal address, X1:x1, destined for an external
   address X2':x2' that has an active mapping to an internal address
   X2:x2, back to that internal address, X2:x2.  Note that typically X1'
   is the same as X2'.

   Furthermore, the NAT may present the hairpinned packet with either an
   internal (X1:x1) or an external (X1':x1') source IP address and port.
   Therefore, the hairpinning NAT behavior can be either "External
   source IP address and port" or "Internal source IP address and port".
   "Internal source IP address and port" may cause problems by confusing
   implementations that expect an external IP address and port.














Filtering Behavior UDP 

   This section describes various filtering behaviors observed in NATs.

   When an internal endpoint opens an outgoing session through a NAT,
   the NAT assigns a filtering rule for the mapping between an internal
   IP:port (X:x) and external IP:port (Y:y) tuple.

   The key behavior to describe is what criteria are used by the NAT to
   filter packets originating from specific external endpoints.

      Endpoint-Independent Filtering:

         The NAT filters out only packets not destined to the internal
         address and port X:x, regardless of the external IP address and
         port source (Z:z).  The NAT forwards any packets destined to
         X:x.  In other words, sending packets from the internal side of
         the NAT to any external IP address is sufficient to allow any
         packets back to the internal endpoint.

      Address-Dependent Filtering:

         The NAT filters out packets not destined to the internal
         address X:x.  Additionally, the NAT will filter out packets
         from Y:y destined for the internal endpoint X:x if X:x has not
         sent packets to Y:any previously (independently of the port
         used by Y).  In other words, for receiving packets from a
         specific external endpoint, it is necessary for the internal
         endpoint to send packets first to that specific external
         endpoint's IP address.

      Address and Port-Dependent Filtering:

         This is similar to the previous behavior, except that the
         external port is also relevant.  The NAT filters out packets
         not destined for the internal address X:x.  Additionally, the
         NAT will filter out packets from Y:y destined for the internal
         endpoint X:x if X:x has not sent packets to Y:y previously.  In
         other words, for receiving packets from a specific external
         endpoint, it is necessary for the internal endpoint to send
         packets first to that external endpoint's IP address and port.
